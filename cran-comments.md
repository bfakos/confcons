## Resubmission (#2)

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

-   Removed all \dontrun{}s and \donttest{}s from the examples and embraced with try() those codes that intentionally throw error or warning.

## Resubmission (#1)

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

-   Added citation with DOI to Description part of the DESCRIPTION file.

-   Switched from \dontrun{} to \donttest{} where possible. Please note that some of the examples intentionally cause errors. These remained within \dontrun{}.

## R CMD check results

0 errors \| 0 warnings \| 1 note

-   This is a new release.
